# Technical Writing
-------
I am a principal technical writer and content strategist in enterprise software. I have a passion for creating narrative-driven content, and I want to begin sharing the best practices that I have learned over the years. I also hope to find some great open source projects that need help with their documentation. 

Now and then I post random musings on my blog at [paulwozniczka.com](http://www.paulwozniczka.com).

## Why I Love Technical Writing

I love *technical writing* because it lets me create content for different purposes and a diverse range of products. I enjoy thinking about different approaches to presenting content and also helping users solve their problems. This content includes text, diagrams, audio, or video; whatever it takes! 

I do not know exactly why I became a technical writer, but perhaps I just enjoy telling people what to do? I love to provide narrative-driven content because I love to tell the user a story. I also focus on the *why* instead of just the *how* and *what*.

I also try to *leave no stone unturned*. I want to provide a complete *end-to-end* view, so I avoid too many assumptions about my user. Do **NOT** always assume that users meet or understand your 500 prerequisites!

## Skills

Technical writers have a broad range of skills that go beyond *writing* procedures and overview information.

Typical technical writing skills include:
* **Structured Writing**
   - Providing an _Information Architecture_ to structure large volumes of information
   - Organizing content into specific types, such as concepts, processes, and tasks (DITA)
* **Content Strategy**
   - Involving the planning, designing, authoring, and innovating of technical content
   - Determining the appropriate content type for your audience, including API reference, technical specifications, visual overviews, procedural information, and rich media
* **Audience Analysis**
   - Understanding the intended users of the content and helping them solve their problems
   - Acting as the user when authoring and testing content
* **Rich Media Production**
   - Recording, editing, and producing dynamic content for YouTube
   - Developing interactive content including instructional videos and tutorials
* **Project Management**
   - Managing content throughout the product development lifecycle
   - Navigating through different levels of an organization
* **Functionality Verification**
   - Testing the user interface as a customer advocate
   - Providing feedback to help improve the _User Experience_

This list only scratches the surface. We do **A LOT**.
