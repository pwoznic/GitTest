# Technical Writing
-------
I am a principal technical writer and content strategist with many years of experience. I have a passion for creating narrative-driven content, and I want to begin sharing the best practices that I have learned over the years. I also hope to find some great open source projects that need help with their documentation. 

I will post various documents in this repo.
