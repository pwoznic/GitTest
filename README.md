# Technical Writing
-------
I am a principal technical writer and content strategist in enterprise software. I have a passion for creating narrative-driven content, and I want to begin sharing the best practices that I have learned throughout my career. I also hope to find some great open source projects that need help with their documentation.

Now and then I post random musings on my blog at [paulwozniczka.com](http://www.paulwozniczka.com).

## Why I Love Technical Writing

I love *technical writing* because it lets me create content for different purposes and a diverse range of products. I enjoy thinking about different approaches to presenting content and also helping users solve their problems. This content includes text, diagrams, audio, or video; whatever it takes! I absolutely love having creative freedom in crafting the perfect content. My teams trust me to provide the best content.

I do not know exactly why I became a technical writer, but perhaps I just enjoy telling people what to do? I always enjoyed writing, and technical writing lets me approach problems from a high-level view and then begin to immediately break down all the steps. Have you ever been frustrated by reading lots of content but you never solved your problem? This style of writing provides a very "A to Z" presentation to solve your problem!

I love to provide narrative-driven content because I love to tell the user a story. I also focus on the *why* instead of just the *how* and *what*. I also try to *leave no stone unturned*. I want to provide a complete *end-to-end* view, so I avoid too many assumptions about my user. Do **NOT** always assume that users meet or understand your 500 prerequisites!

## Technical Writer Skillset

Technical writers have a broad range of skills that go beyond *writing* procedures and overview information. I often wear many hats, and I enjoy it! I thrive in this kind of environment!

These broad range of technical writing skills include:
* **Structured Writing**
   - Providing an _Information Architecture_ to structure large volumes of information
   - Organizing content into specific types, such as concepts, processes, and tasks (DITA)
* **Content Strategy**
   - Involving the planning, designing, authoring, and innovating of technical content
   - Determining the appropriate content type for your audience, including API references, SDK documentation, technical specifications, visual overviews, procedures, and rich media
* **Audience Analysis**
   - Understanding the intended users of the content and helping them solve their problems
   - Knowing who will consume your content and ensure that it meets their needs
* **Professional Writing**
   - Modifying the format and tone based on the purposes
   - Writing for customer decision makers, legal, product marketing, and other corporate roles
* **Rich Media Production**
   - Recording, editing, and producing dynamic content for YouTube
   - Developing interactive content including instructional videos and tutorials
* **Project Management**
   - Managing content throughout the product development lifecycle
   - Navigating through different levels of an organization
* **Functionality Verification**
   - Testing the user interface as a customer advocate
   - Providing feedback to help improve the _User Experience_

This list of skills only scratches the surface. We do **A LOT**.

## Product Documentation Experience

I have worked on many enterprise products in both mainframe and distributed where I specialized in planning, writing, restructuring, and editing technical documentation.

In the examples that follow, I wrote a majority of the product documentation. The most notable areas are Release Notes, Getting Started, Installing, Administering, Implementing, Using, and Reference. These particular sections get the most traffic in most product documentation spaces. These projects operate in a global, Agile environment with large development teams. The customers that use these products include various government agencies, almost every major financial and banking organization, large retailers, and so on.

I have lead the technical writing efforts and teams for the following projects (remember to Ctrl+Click to open the link in a new tab!):
1. [CA Mainframe Operational Intelligence](https://docops.ca.com/moi)
 - The *Getting Started*, *Preparing for Installation*, *Installing*, and *Integrating* sections received an STC Award of Excellence!
 - The thorough prerequisite and installation information was vetted by customers to ensure a smooth installation of a complex, multi-product solution.
 - Whenever possible, I add *architectural diagrams* to help customesr with implementing a solution.
 - The *Installation Checklist* was a big hit with our customers!
 - The *Troubleshooting* section helps customers resolve their common issues, so that they do not have to contact support.
2. [CA OPSMVS Event Management and Automation](https://docops.ca.com/ca-opsmvs/13-5/en)
 - I documented many specific *parameter* and *coding examples* to improve the reference information.
 - The primary audience of many parts of this documentation are developers who need specific coding examples to help set up and maintain event automation in their environments.
 - The *Best Practices* section contains content that our customers wanted featured more prominently.
3. [Mainframe Team Center - Content Viewer](https://docops.ca.com/ca-mainframe-team-center-content-viewer/14-0/en/api-reference)
 - The *API Reference* uses Swagger and OpenAPI and this content also won an STC Award!
 - API Developers have provided excellent feedback about this content. In addition to Swagger, I used a reference style that I helped standardize at my company because it helped with the PDF output (Swagger does not export to PDF in Confluence).
 - I created the entire documentation set from scratch because it was a brand new product.
4. [CA Output Management Web Viewer](https://docops.ca.com/ca-output-management-web-viewer/12-1/en/installing)
 - I want to highlight the *Installing* section which covers the various deployment scenarios. Our customers have different environments, so I captured every possible combination.
 - I also provided diagrams to help them plan their deployments and get up and running.
5. [CA XCOM Data Transport for UNIX/Linux](https://docops.ca.com/ca-xcom-data-transport-for-unix-linux/11-6-01/en)
 - The *Overview* content covers several remote systems, including OpenVMS, UNIX, Linux, Windows, z/OS, and z/VM.
 - The *Installing and Upgrading* section follows a standard that helped create for the organization.
6. [Mainframe Team Center - Network Management](https://docops.ca.com/mainframe-team-center-network-management/12-2/en)

7. [CA NetMaster Network Management for TCP/IP](https://docops.ca.com/ca-netmaster-network-management-for-tcpip/12-2/en)
 - This product has several related documentation sets, many of which are *Reference* content.
 - The *Administering* section provides examples of my style when writing task-based documentation that is also easily searchable.
8. [CA View](https://docops.ca.com/ca-view/14-0/en)
 - This example shows the various *audiences* that I craft my content.
 - The *Installing* and *Configuration* content ensures that customers can get up and running with a powerful product.
9. [CA Service Desk Manager](https://docops.ca.com/ca-service-management/17-1/en)
 - The *Administering* content shows more example of my task-based writing.
